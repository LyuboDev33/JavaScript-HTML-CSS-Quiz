This is a simple 30 question quiz on JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Technologies used to complete the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP and MySQL. 

Whenever the test gets submitted, the checked answers become "disabled" and this gets stored in localstorage so that you can only do the quiz once.
(Yes, you can use another browser and do it again, but we will have the results from your first try stored in the database :) 

This project doesn't have the functionality of sending emails once the test is completed,
however it does provide a search bar below the test so you can check your result (points, names, score etc). 

You can go ahead and try out the real test @ https://lubodev.com/formValidation/index.html. 

Good luck :)
